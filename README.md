## 📲 Installation Guide (Android)

Follow these steps to install the application manually using the `.apk` file.

### 1. Download the APK
Download the latest `.apk` file from the **[Releases](https://github.com/brysoncotton/ScriptureStudyAid/releases)** section of this repository directly onto your Android device.

### 2. Disable Samsung "Auto Blocker" (Samsung Devices Only)
If you are using a modern Samsung Galaxy device (One UI 6.0+), you must temporarily disable the **Auto Blocker** security feature:
1. Open **Settings** > **Security and Privacy**.
2. Tap on **Auto Blocker**.
3. Toggle the switch to **Off**. 
   * *Note: You can re-enable this once the installation is finished.*

### 3. Enable "Install Unknown Apps"
Android requires permission for the specific app (e.g., Chrome or File Manager) that is launching the installer.
1. Open **Settings** > **Apps**.
2. Tap the **Three-dot menu** (top right) and select **Special access** (or search for "Special app access").
3. Select **Install unknown apps**.
4. Locate the app you used to download/find the file (e.g., **Chrome** or **My Files**) and toggle it **ON**.

### 4. Install the Application
1. Open your **File Manager** or **Downloads** folder and tap the `.apk` file.
2. When the system prompt appears, tap **Install**.
3. **Google Play Protect:** If a "Blocked by Play Protect" popup appears, tap **More details**, then tap **Install anyway**.

### 5. Security Cleanup (Recommended)
To keep your device secure, it is recommended to:
* Return to the **Install unknown apps** settings and toggle the permission **OFF**.
* Re-enable **Auto Blocker** if you are on a Samsung device.
